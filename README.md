## Introduction

The NeuralNetwork project showcases a simple neural network built with TensorFlow. The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The goal is to accurately predict the digit represented in each image.

## Features

- Utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the neural network
- Processes and predicts handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset
- Includes visualization of training progress and results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhik123-creator/NeuralNetwork.git
    cd NeuralNetwork
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
    ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
